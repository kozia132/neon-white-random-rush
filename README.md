# neon white random rush

little console app that lets you make random custom rushes
opening it gives you 5 options,
1. generate random rush
2. add a level to the ban list
3. remove a level from the ban list
4. view the ban list
5. exit

the ban list file works on a level id basis, so if you want to add levels manually youll have to do it through the level ids
if you want a list of the level ids and their corresponding names, you can find them easily with this sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ShxOAHtBXyyP1OtLzrFat_0QUFM24sUZLVBg6zaMvPM/edit?gid=458476982#gid=458476982
