# neon white random rush

little console app that lets you make random custom rushes
opening it gives you 5 options,
1. generate random rush
2. add a level to the ban list
3. remove a level from the ban list
4. view the ban list
5. exit

the ban list simply removes a level from being able to be generated

most of this was chatgpt'd, im not actually very good at programming icant
