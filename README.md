# neon white random rush

little console app that lets you make random custom rushes
opening it gives you 5 options,
1. generate random rush
2. add a level to the ban list
3. remove a level from the ban list
4. view the ban list
5. exit

the ban list file works on a level id basis, so if you want to add levels manually youll have to do it through the level ids

most of this was chatgpt'd, im not actually very good at programming icant
